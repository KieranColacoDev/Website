            <h2>Kieran Colaco - Front End Developer</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Kieran Colaco and I’m a Front End Web Developer. I have a Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science that I earned from Brock University. I have always had a passion for coding and building interactive applications that fits a user’s needs and wants. I started building websites from a young age when I was first introduced to computer science and programming in high school. I instantly fell in love with programming and knew that I wanted to become a developer when I grew older. Every year I try to add different skills to my skillset to improve the overall quality and design of my websites. I learn a lot of these skills by watching YouTube tutorials online and building test projects and applications. When I’m not coding or learning new programming skills, I like to spend my free time playing sports such as Soccer, Basketball, and Volleyball. I also like playing video games with my friends and watching interesting TV shows and movies. I am a hard worker and I always put in the time and effort to get better at my craft.

The CMS features an editor that has multiple elements that can be easily dragged and dropped onto to the screen to start building a website. The CMS was created by myself and 7 other programmers. I was the leader for the front end section of the editor for the CMS and was responsible for creating the design and layout of the editor. The editor section was created using mainly React. Other technologies that were used in the CMS include Node.JS, PHP, Postgres, HTML, SASS, and Parcel.<br><br> View: <a href="http://cosc.brocku.ca/~c4f00g02/projectWixs/#/">Project Wixs</a></p>
