            <h2>Kieran Colaco - Front End Developer</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Kieran Colaco and I’m a Front End Web Developer. I have my Bachelors of Science (with a major in Computer Science) that I earned from Brock University. I have always had a passion for coding and building applications that users can use and interact it. I started building websites from a young age when I was first introduced to computer science and programming. Every year I try to add different skills to my skillset to improve the overall quality and design of my websites. When I’m not coding or learning new programming skills, I like to spend my free time playing sports such as Soccer, Basketball, and Volleyball. I also like playing video games with my friends and watching interesting TV shows and movies. I am a hard worker and I always put in the time and effort to get better at my craft. </p>

                <h2>Web Design</h2>
                <p>I have been designing websites for multiple years and have learned many skills to make my websites look beautiful, clean, and responsive. Some of these web design skills include languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks such as React and Angular. I have also worked with multiple design programs such as Photoshop and InDesign in order to create graphics to be used for the websites I create. I have also studied User Interface design and know what users look for when they are using an application.</p>

                <h2>Software Dev</h2>
                <p>Creating useful and effective software for users to use and interact with has always been one of my favorite things to do. I have great knowledge of the core software development fundamentals such as planning, analysis, design, implementation, documenting, testing, and maintenance. I have also created software using both the Agile and Waterfall methods of creating software. I have strong programming skills in the following languages: Java, Python, C#, and SQL.</p>

                <p>Along with my strong technical skills, I also possess many strong work skills that will help me be successful in a work environment where I will be interacting and working with other people. Some of these work skills include: strong leadership qualities, good problem solving skills, excellent time management, not afraid to ask questions, great adaptability, working well with others, strong presentation and speech skills, passion for wanting to learn and improve, accountability, and a very outgoing personality.</p>

                    <p>Created a Content Management System called Project Wixs that allows users to easily build their own websites. The CMS features an editor that has multiple elements that can be easily dragged and dropped onto to the screen to start building a website. The CMS was created by myself and 7 other programmers. I was the leader for the front end section of the editor for the CMS and was responsible for creating the design and layout of the editor. The editor section was created using mainly React. Other technologies that were used in the CMS include Node.JS, PHP, Postgres, HTML, SASS, and Parcel.<br><br> View: <a href="http://cosc.brocku.ca/~c4f00g02/projectWixs/#/">Project Wixs</a></p>
